# About

This is a pure JavaScript implementation of the ContrAlto Xerox Alto
emulator.

The end goal is a usable, performant Xerox Alto emulator running in
your web browser.

# Status

The project is usable, with some known bugs. It should be considered
early beta quality.

# Credits

This project would not have been possible without The Living Computer Museum's
[ContrAlto](https://github.com/livingcomputermuseum/ContrAlto) project, of
which this is a direct port. The architecture and design is theirs; I merely
translated the project from C# to JavaScript.
